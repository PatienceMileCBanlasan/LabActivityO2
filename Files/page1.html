      <ul>
        <li>My favorite position is the setter; a setter serves as the control tower of the team.</li>
        <li>Although setting looks simple, it can be strenuous both physically and mentally.</li>
        <li>Volleyball nurtures valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, and dedication.</li>
